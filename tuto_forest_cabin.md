The **forest cabin** is connected to [[tuto_forest_trail01 ()]] and will introduce the player to the first minigame: lockpicking. Since the player's objective is to investigate the cabin, they will not be able to return to the trails after finding it.

Currently, there are no sketches, but they should follow the same design as [[tuto_forest_trail01 ()]] and [[tuto_forest_trail02 ()]] for consistency.

The story can be seen here: [[Tutorial Story Version 1]].

The graphics are done here: [[tuto_graphics for the lock picking]].
