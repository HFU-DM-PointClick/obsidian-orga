# Game in general

By the end of the year, we aim to have a playable 2D point-and-click horror game featuring multiple endings based on the players decisions, along with all the essential must haves. The should haves and could haves are optional. AI should have the capability to influence item spawning probabilities, leading to unexpected twists and enhancing replayability. Additionally, we could have a system where player choices affect not just the storyline, but also the game environment, creating a more intense experience. The fights are turn based.

# Audio

We should include multiple selfmade songs for different scenes, fitting the overall vibe of the game (potentially in an 8-bit style). The sound effects could also be selfmade. The AI generated voices could adapt emotions, depending on the character's mood or the intensity of the situation. We could also consider using ambient sounds to build tension and enhance the atmosphere throughout the gameplay (depends on the final visuals tho).

# Visuals

We should aim to master character design and pixel art, as the entire game will be made in this specific style. The color palette will be dark with low saturation for a fitting mood. Characters will be animated to enhance the atmosphere and to portray emotions effectively. The monsters in the game will be designed with an abstract aesthetic, perhaps with distorted shapes to create an unsettling effect. Additionally, we could add switching backgrounds which reflect the psychological state of the main character.

# Story

The game will feature at least one playable story with a dark and mysterious theme. The story will involve eldritch beings and will change significantly based on the players decisions. Moreover, we can add hints regarding the story and monsters so the player can slowly understand what's going on. The main character is a detective that gets crazy over the time, trying to solve a case unlike any he has faced before.
