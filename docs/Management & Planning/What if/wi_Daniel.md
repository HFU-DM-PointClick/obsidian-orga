A Functional game with atleast one Ending so that you have something playable

A Game that isnt to complex but still gives you the satisfaction and is Fun to play (you shouldn´t feel forced to play it)

delivering a good Atmos so it is easy for the player to feel included in the story and you don´t notice the time.

Emmersiv Audio and sound design so that the music can reinforce the feeling for the current location where the player is in and deliver the spine chilling atmospher

fitting visuals to the story that represent the game asthetic and current location / action

easy to follow story (you don´t get lost easy in the plot)
