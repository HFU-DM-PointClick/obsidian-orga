My vision for the game is to create a standout experience through immersive level design and environmental storytelling. 
A dark, depressive atmosphere will be crucial to building a compelling sense of dread and tension, allowing players to feel the weight of the protagonist’s journey. 
The game will be short yet amazing, focusing on delivering a polished experience. 
Additionally, the inclusion of multiple endings and various paths will enhance replayability, encouraging players to uncover all aspects of the story and the choices

And here’s what I wouldn’t want: a buggy game that suffers from overly ambitious ideas that we can’t bring to completion. I envision something simple but refined—focusing on quality over quantity to deliver a solid, cohesive experience.
