Guy 1 (Michael Shelley): [looks scared] 

I: Sit down.

G1: …

I: I’m sure you know why you’re here, right?

G1: … 

I: … Mr. Shelley?

G1: … it’s not gonna get in here, right?  
  
I: What is?  
  
G1: The- thing! With- with the-  
  
I: [Interested] The what?  
  
G1: The monster with the eyes and stuff!  
  
I: A… *monster*?  
  
G1: YES! It- it was huge and- had claws and- and- it came out of nowhere and attacked us with the tentacles and-  
  
I: … tentacles.  
  
G1: Yes! And huge glowing eyeballs! We were having fun and it suddenly attacked and - it’s not getting in here, is it?  
  
I: … So you say you were having fun and then you were attacked by something?  
  
G1: A monster.  
  
I: Yes, right, a monster…  
  
G1: … you don’t believe me, do you?!  
  
I: Mr. Shelley, please.  
  
G1: No, no! I am telling the truth! There was a monster! I am not making this up, we were attacked, I am not lying, I am not lying!  
  
I: I wasn’t saying that you are-  
  
G1: No, you did, your eyes did, it’s coming, it’s coming after us for waking it!  
  
I: …

Trial 2:

  

I: [looks at new person expectantly]  
  
Guy 2: [looks rather scared and stubborn] …

I: … are you gonna talk?  
  
G2: …

I: You can go to jail for not helping the investigations.  
  
G2: …  
  
I: Or murder, if you have no alibi.  
  
G2: …  
  
I: …

G2: …  
  
I: … this is pointless if you’re not talking. [hits table] Next one. 

  


Trial 3: 

  

Guy 3: Why are you looking at me like that?  
  
I: You’re a suspect.  
  
G3: I’m a suspect?! Please. I didn’t do anything! If you wanna arrest someone, arrest the others. 

I: Why is that?  
  
G3: It was their idea to begin with! They were stupid enough to get us into this, they should be the ones paying for it! 

I: And what exactly would that be?  
  
G3: It was all Gerry and his stupid book! It was his idea! Ask him!

I: Gerry as in… *checks list* Gerard Keay?  
  
G3: Yeah! Him!  
  
I: He is on my list. … can you tell me anything about what happened?  
  
G3: Why do you want to know? Do you want to pin it on me?! Is that what this is?  
  
I: No, I merely-  
  
G3: Who do you think you are, tough boy, thinking you get to walk all over me and call me small and try to blame me for the death of that loser?! I’m not letting you!  
  
I: Mr. Morrison.  
  
G3: Don’t you do that! Don’t you go and do that to me! I have rights!  
  
I: Mr. Morrison, please calm down. 

G3: Calm down? CALM DOWN?! After this bullshit you’re pulling on me?! No! I am not going to calm down!  
  
I: Mr. Morrison- … *to the side* lead him outside, please.  
  
G3: Outside?! Are you throwing me back in that cell?! You can’t do that, you can’t- …

I: … Gerard Keay, hm? 

  

Trial 4: 

  

I: Maybe this one… 

I: Do you know why you’re here?

Guy 4: Uh…

I: Well? Do you know why you’re here?
  
G4: … not really…

I: What do you mean, not really?

G4: I mean… I know it’s because of what happened to [teen]… but…

I: But?  
  
G4: … I … can’t remember? I mean… last I remember was us hanging out after school and wanting to meet him - and then suddenly - he’d dead. In front of me. Everyone panics. And then… I’m here.  
  
I: … you don’t remember anything? *At all*?  
  
G4: No, I… there’s… nothing really… I would tell you if I knew, I swear! … just… flashes… eyes, maybe? 

I: Are you sure you aren’t messing with me?  
  
G4: Of course! My uncle is also police, I would never do anything to hinder investigations!

I: *sigh* Alright. Thank you for your time, I guess…

  

Trial 5:

  

I: *sigh* this is getting old… next one.  
  
Guy 5 (Gerard Keay): …  
  
I: … are you okay?  
  
G5: This is my fault… all my fault…  
  
I: Why is it your fault?  
  
G5: I - it was just a prank… just a - we wanted to scare him, not… 

I: … what happened, Mr. Keay?

G5: It was just a prank… a prank… we met him to scare him a bit, nothing more… I found this book and… then suddenly there was that- *thing*… and- it killed him… its eyes…

I: Thing?  
  
g5: It was all - weird and - tentacles and-  
  
I: *sigh* a monster?  
  
g5: Yes! A monster! It killed him!  
  
I: And you’re sure about that? You had that book and then suddenly that monster appeared?  
  
G5: Yes! It was supposed to be fake, I swear! It shouldn’t have been real! 

I: Where did you find that book?  
  
G5: Some second hand book shop, Pinhole Books or something…  
  
I: So… you found some random book and decided to spook him with it? And then a … monster appeared and attacked? 

G5: Yes, that… seems about right… I never should have suggested that prank to the others… god, what did I do…

I: Mr. Keay, focus, please.  
  
g5: It’s all my fault… it’s all my fault… I killed him… I killed him…

I: Mr Keay. … *sigh* Thank you.
