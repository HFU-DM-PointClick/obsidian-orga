# **What's our project?**
We'd like to work on a 2D point and click mystery game. The game is played in the perspective of a detective. While playing you have to solve different cases with a very dark atmosphere. The game is created in a pixel style and the music is selfmade. Please note the following list of things the game must have, should have and could have.

# **Target groups**
With our game we'll try to target cosmic horror fans and point-and-click adventure gamers.

| **Must have**                | **Should have**           | **Could Have**                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| A playable short story       | More than one short story | Multiple stories with character progression |
| Two different endings        | Interactive combat system | Custom story editor                         |
| Original art and music       | Custom color palette      | Multiple-choice storylines                  |
| AI influences the story      |                           | Customizable characters                     |
| AI generated voices included |                           |                                             |

# **Features compared to other games**
we couldn't find any other point and click adventure game with such a style. The fighting system changes the story and the probabilities for decision concerning events. This adds the opportunity to have an impact on the storyline and changes the chance to win.

# **Resolution for the pixel art**
2048x2048 (not the final decision yet) for better details (take a look at the references like the World of Horror one).

# **What would a happy user sound like?**
"The game really captures the atmosphere!"
"I feel fully immersed in the story."
"My decisions actually matter and influence the outcome."

# **Inspiration**
Junji Ito, H.P. Lovecraft, World of Horror, Path of Exile, Edna & Harvey: The Breakout, Dredge, Deadalic, Harvey's New Eyes and Deponia 1-3.
