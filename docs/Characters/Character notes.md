### Short summary:

Middle aged ex-police officer, who is roped into playing the detective when the only police officer of a rural town is killed.

His son died when he was at work, and he wasn’t there to save him.  
Thus has conflicting feelings about work..  
Has been left by his wife.

### Personality:

- Done with the world and investigation, moves to Furtwangen
- Does not care as much about his career anymore:  
    Is thus not taking too much care of looks
- Skeptic
- Drinks too much
    

### Description:

- Does not care much about his Uniform anymore  
    -> Wrinkled, unironed white shirts with rolled up sleeves  
    -> High police pants (Either blue or cream coloured) with a dark leather belt  
    -> Police blue Jacket, casually thrown over his shoulder  
    -> Muscular but not fully, let himself go (Broad shoulders, but not too burly or muscly)
- Dark rings under his eyes
- Scar on his arm
- Has a modern watch that was gifted from his wife that left him
- Dark brown hair, short (Maybe curled? Slightly messy, but using hair products? See Gabriel Knight references)
- Classic brown shoes, good but older. Maybe still gets it repaired by a shoemaker even in this time and age
- blue eyes

  

### Artstyle:

- Pixel art -> Make every detail count
- The colour palette should be using many, but stylized and somewhat earthy colours. Moody surroundings, always a little dull and hostile but dusty and distant (f.ex. Inmost, Lumine Night, Gabriel Knight Sins of the fathers);  
    Another option would be a more simple, monochromatic and moody noir palette
- The character art is at most size 32x64pixels -> Not too many tiny details should be used, since it is difficult to show in such a level of abstraction
- Question: Lineless? Or with Lineart? Lineless might suit the vibe better
- Considering the depiction of certain story beats
- Not depicting the face clearly (like Gabriel knight) allows for more “mature” proportions and more mystery and a feeling of detachment to the main character.  
    Depicting the face or emphasizing it (f.ex. Pocket Mirror) makes the character seem  more cute.
