The most important part of writing/creating a story is the character itself. If you create your character correctly, the story writes itself - f. ex. a young girl who is broke and loves animals inherits a pelt factory. 

__Every character needs:
- goal (drive)
   Why do they do what they do, what keeps them going
- weakness (if in personality or powers)
   A character without weakness is boring and unrelatable
- fear
- darkest secret
- Name (fitting name, you canâ€™t name a little flower girl something like Verosika or a gangster boss Milo - like, those maybe work, but there are better fits)
- Age
- appearance (how they clothe, how they look)
- walk (how they walk says a lot about who they are)
- friends/enemies
- backstory - how did they grow up, what happened to them, why are they here

All those things make up a character's unique personality and make them who they are

For a good story, you also need a conflict, mostly of interest, like, character wants to go home but a dragon blocks his path so he needs to train to defeat it or something. Can be very simple, but needs to capture audience.
