### **ChatGPT (GPT-4 API) vs. Llama 3 (Ollama)**

#### **ChatGPT (GPT-4 API)** with a dedicated account for the game:

- **Advantages:**
    - ChatGPT offers the **best text quality** on the market. Complex dialogue, deep character development, and dynamic responses would be most impressive using this model.
    - Using a separate account specifically for the game ensures that no personal data or sensitive content is at risk.
    - The API integration is relatively simple and requires no additional hardware.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - **Cost:** The API incurs ongoing fees, which can grow quickly depending on the number of requests. This could be an issue for a student project.
    - **Internet dependency:** The game requires a stable internet connection, which could be a barrier for players who want to play offline.
- **Assessment:**
    - If we are willing to cover the API costs and the game is intended to be played online, ChatGPT is the most powerful option. A dedicated account minimizes any security or privacy concerns.

#### **Llama 3 (Ollama):**

- **Advantages:**
    - **Offline capability:** The model runs entirely locally, making it ideal for a point-and-click adventure that should be playable without internet access.
    - **Efficiency:** Llama 3 is optimized and requires fewer hardware resources than other models of similar quality.
    - **Lower error rate:** Compared to Llama 2, the error rate is reduced by over one-third, resulting in more reliable and immersive dialogue.
    - **Cost-effective:** No ongoing fees, making it ideal for a student project.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - **Attribution requirement:** We must visibly mention "Built with Meta Llama 3" in the game, which is a minor limitation.
    - **Dependency on Ollama:** Llama 3 is currently tied to the Ollama platform, meaning we depend on their updates and support.
- **Assessment:**
    - Llama 3 via Ollama is ideal if we want a powerful, offline-capable solution with no recurring costs. It's perfectly suited for our project.
