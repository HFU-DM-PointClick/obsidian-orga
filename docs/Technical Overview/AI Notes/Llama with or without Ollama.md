#### **Can we use Llama 2 with Ollama?**

- **Answer:** Yes, Ollama also supports **Llama 2**, and we can use it via the platform. The same advantages as with Llama 3 (e.g., optimization and easy integration) apply here as well. However, Llama 3 offers better text quality and a lower error rate, making it the better choice overall.

#### **Can we use Llama 3 without Ollama?**

- **Answer:** Technically, yes â€” Llama 3 is an open-source model. However, we would have to set it up manually using tools like **Llama.cpp**. This requires significant technical effort, including configuration, optimization, and potentially quantization. Ollama greatly simplifies this process, which is why it's more practical for our project to use Llama 3 via Ollama.
