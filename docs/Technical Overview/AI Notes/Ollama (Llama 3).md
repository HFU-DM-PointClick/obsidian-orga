### **5. Differences Compared to Llama 2**

**Comparison between Llama 2 (Standalone) and Llama 3 via Ollama:**

| **Aspect**              | **Llama 2 (Standalone)**                              | **Llama 3 via Ollama**                       |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Setup**               | Manual configuration required (e.g., with Llama.cpp)   | Plug-and-play through the Ollama platform     |
| **Ease of use**         | Technically demanding, but more customization options  | Very easy to use, but less flexible           |
| **Text quality**        | Good, especially in smaller models                     | Very good, especially with complex context     |
| **Hardware efficiency** | Efficient, especially the 7B version                   | Even more efficient due to Ollama optimizations |
| **Customizability**     | Fully customizable (supports complete fine-tuning)     | Limited customization options                 |
| **Licensing**           | Open source, no restrictions                           | Possible license restrictions from Ollama     |

**Summary of differences:**

- **Llama 2 (Standalone)** provides more freedom and full control, but requires technical expertise and manual configuration.
- **Llama 3 via Ollama** is more user-friendly and offers higher text quality but is less flexible and may be subject to licensing terms.
