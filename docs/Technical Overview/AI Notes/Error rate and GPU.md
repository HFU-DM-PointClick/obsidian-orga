#### **1. Llama 2**

- **Error Rate:**
    - Higher rate of "false refusals" compared to newer models like Llama 3. It sometimes rejects requests it could technically fulfill.
- **GPU Requirements:**
    - **Recommended:** NVIDIA GPUs with at least 12 GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 3060 or better).
    - Also works with AMD GPUs if compatible libraries like ROCm are used.
    - For smaller models (7B), CPU-based use is possible but significantly slower.

#### **2. Llama 3 (Ollama)**

- **Error Rate:**
    - Reduces the error rate by more than one-third compared to Llama 2, resulting in more reliable responses.
- **GPU Requirements:**
    - Ollama is optimized for both CPU and GPU usage.
    - **Recommended:** NVIDIA GPUs with at least 12 GB VRAM (RTX 3060 or better).
    - Thanks to quantization (e.g., 4-bit), Llama 3 runs efficiently even on devices with limited memory.

#### **3. GPT-J**

- **Error Rate:**
    - Moderate, lower than Llama 2, but less capable when handling complex queries.
- **GPU Requirements:**
    - **Recommended:** NVIDIA GPUs with 12 GB VRAM or more.
    - AMD GPUs are supported via ROCm, though with limitations.
    - For lightweight tasks, CPU use is possible, but performance is significantly slower.

#### **4. GPT-NeoX**

- **Error Rate:**
    - Similar to GPT-J but performs better on complex queries.
- **GPU Requirements:**
    - **Minimum:** NVIDIA GPUs with 20 GB VRAM (e.g., RTX A5000 or higher).
    - For large models (20B), multi-GPU support is required.
    - AMD GPU support is experimental.

---

#### **5. ChatGPT (GPT-4 API)**

- **Error Rate:**
    - Very low, offering precise and reliable responses.
- **GPU Requirements:**
    - No local GPU required, as all processing is handled in the cloud.
    - Minimal hardware on the client side (any internet-capable device is sufficient).

### **Solutions for Reducing Error Rate**

1. **Fine-tuning:**

    - Especially useful for Llama 2 or GPT-J to reduce false refusals.
    - Requires NVIDIA GPUs with at least 12 GB VRAM.
    - Effort: High

2. **Fallback logic in the game:**

    - Catch rejections by rephrasing requests or providing default responses.
    - Effort: Medium

3. **Switch to Llama 3 (Ollama):**

    - Reduces error rate without additional development effort.
    - Ollama optimizes models for NVIDIA GPUs and offers efficient solutions for low-spec devices.
    - Effort: Low
