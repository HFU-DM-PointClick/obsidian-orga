V0.1
Rough estimate how it should look and feel
![[gui_v01.png]]

We have the game view in Blue what the Player should see
the phone on the bottom right acts as game menu for the player after pressing it will open upwards and show different apps which the player can choose from one the app on the top left acts as map when pressed it will open the map on the whole game view where the player can select different locations he wishes to travel to
the app left from the map is the evidence board a quality of life improvement for the player so he can change and combine all the things without moving to the office
other apps may include a quest log so the player has a reminder on his objective
and the inventory since we need it

V0.2
![[gui v02.png]]
Changed the Location for the "Clock" now the time is visible on the phone which has been moved more to the top to display the Time
Added two more Apps one for the Inventory as seen below and one for the Questlog (Current Objectives)

Rough design when pressed on the Inventory App it should open the Inventory as shown in the referenz and pause the game while being open (same as applied when saving or loading the game)
