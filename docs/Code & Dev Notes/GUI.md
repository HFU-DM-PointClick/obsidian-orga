V0.1
Rough estimate how it should look and feel
![[gui_v01.png]]

We have the game view in Blue what the Player should see
the phone on the bottom right acts as game menu for the player after pressing it will open upwards and show different apps which the player can choose from one the app on the top left acts as map when pressed it will open the map on the whole game view where the player can select different locations he wishes to travel to
the app left from the map is the evidence board a quality of life improvement for the player so he can change and combine all the things without moving to the office
other apps may include a quest log so the player has a reminder on his objective
and the inventory since we need it
