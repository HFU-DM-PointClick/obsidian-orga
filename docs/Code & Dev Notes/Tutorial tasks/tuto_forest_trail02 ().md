**trail02** is connected to **trail01**, as seen here: [[tuto_forest_trail01 ()]]. The player is able to find clues that the friend group has been here and couldnâ€™t have moved far. The player will be rewarded for exploring with a clue that can help in the trials.

Currently, there are no sketches, but the design should be consistent with [[tuto_forest_trail01 ()]] for a seamless transition.
