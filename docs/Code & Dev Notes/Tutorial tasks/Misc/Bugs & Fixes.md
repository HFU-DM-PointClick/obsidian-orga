Located Sources with same issue of false Sprite sheet Animation

No fix
(https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/31699)

Changed layout of Sprite sheet but it shouldnÂ´t fix anything in theory

Checked the Godot docs but we did the same thing for the Animation still have the same error on AMD GPU
