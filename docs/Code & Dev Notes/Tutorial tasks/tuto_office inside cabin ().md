The **inside cabin** should be the next scene after lockpicking the door from [[tuto_forest_cabin]]. Inside the cabin, the player will discover the aftermath of what happened to the missing person and will need to find clues and evidence for the trials ahead, as described in [[Tutorial Story Version 1]].

Currently, there are no sketches or designs for the collectible evidence or the objects to be inspected.
