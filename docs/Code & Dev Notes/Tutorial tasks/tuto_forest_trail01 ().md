For the forest trail01, the idea was to create a simple hiking trail through the forest that connects to forest trail02. In theory, we wanted to give the player a choice of which path to take when proceeding to trail02. The player will end up at a dead end but will find evidence that the group of friends was here and must be nearby, maybe even find evidence that could become important in the trials, but it will be missable and won’t change the outcome of the tutorial.

When taking the other path to the cabin, the player will find the cabin they were searching for, and they won’t be able to backtrack since they’ve achieved their current objective and need to proceed.

Currently, there are no sketches for trail01. The same can be said for trail02 and the cabin, since they should be connected.

The story for this part is written in [[Tutorial Story Version 1]].
