Once we have the design of the main character, we can start implementing them in the game to test what works and what doesn’t. 
Animations won’t be needed yet for this phase, as the focus will be on testing and refining the character’s integration.

- First step is to integrate character in first office scene
- Use idle animation
- Let him walk around on mouse click.
	- Clicking on the door should trigger a walking animation towards the door, first. Then leaving/changing the scene. (same for other items as whiteboard, clock, phone and so on...)
