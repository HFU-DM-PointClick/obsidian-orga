We need to design a main character that fits the environment and timeline. The design shouldnâ€™t be too complex but should remain interesting and easy to recognize so the player can instantly detect their location in the scene.

Currently, we have some sketches, but the design direction is still unclear. It needs to align with the overall aesthetic of the game and feel cohesive rather than disconnected.

Game screen resolution is 666x356, hence max size of the full body character is 175px

Include character in all background scenes to check if it fits
