We need animations for the main character but can only start once we have a clear design that fits the theme and setting of the game.

The essential animations we need are **idling, walking, and talking**, which should be our first priority. After that, we can create specific animations, such as **sleeping on the table**, as described in [[Tutorial Story Version 1]].
